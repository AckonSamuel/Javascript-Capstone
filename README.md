# ShowTime

ShowTime is a web application based on an external TV Maze API. The API provides data about TV Shows. We then built the webapp around it. The webapp has 2 user interfaces (pages): The Homepage and the Comment modal. On the Homepage, each Show can be `liked` and `commented` on.

## Built With

- HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Webpack
- Jest
